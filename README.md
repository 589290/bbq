# Scripts

These scripts take a small chunk out of the work of spinning up a cluster, deploying resources, debugging helm, and tearing down BigBang. When performing these steps repeatedly, time is saved. It is assumed you have cloned [this repo](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/bigbang) to `~/bigbang`.
  
## General Daily Workflow  
  
Spin up a cluster  
```
0-k3d
```
  
Deploy flux  
```
1-flux
```

Deploy BigBang  
```
2-bb
```
  
...dev work / change / break / fix things...  
```  
2-bb
```

Deploy a specific local package  
```
3-package
```

Render a helm template to text file for debugging  
```
4-helm-debug
```
  
...work complete; empty the cluster; next task...
```
8-teardown-bb
```
  
Verify a deployment with a clean install.  
  
```
9-del-ec2 && 0-k3d && 1-flux && 2-bb
```

The k3d dev scripts will self terminate the instantiated ec2 VM 8 hours after initial creation or you can save a few AWS ðŸ’° by executing `9-del-ec2` when you're finished with your cluster.  
  
# Some other scripts

### [aliases](scripts/aliases) 
Some useful shortcuts if you live in the terminal everyday.

### [f](scripts/f) `search-term` 
Recursively non-case-sensitively search for file/dir using a `search-term` hiding all stderr msgs.

### [g](scripts/g) `search-term` 
Recursively search the contents of all files in the pwd for a `search-term`.

### [gitt](scripts/gitt) `commmit msg here`
`git` add . && `git` commit with the commit msg parameter && and `git` push in a single command; AMAZING.    
  
### [reflux](scripts/reflux) `namespace` 
Pause and then resume flux for a given namespace to speed up the rollout of a previous `helm upgrade` command.  

### [kw](scripts/kw) 
Watch pods, helm releases, and git repos used in flux as during an upgrade.  

 
# Overrides

The [overrides](overrides) can be used to deploy a particular set of packages and are typically hand edited into `2-bb`.
